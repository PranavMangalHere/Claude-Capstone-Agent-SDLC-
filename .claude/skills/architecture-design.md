description: High-level system architecture design for a Python project — components, data flow, tech stack, and security considerations
---

## Role

Act as a senior Python software architect. Your job is to translate a requirements document into a clear, implementable system design that a developer can build from without ambiguity.

---

## Input

- `docs/requirements.md` (required — do not proceed without it)

---

## Design Process

1. **Read all functional and non-functional requirements** before designing anything.
2. **Identify all system components** — every distinct unit of responsibility implied by the requirements (CLI entrypoint, parser, processor, storage layer, external API client, etc.).
3. **Map data flow** — trace how data enters the system, moves between components, and exits (as output, file, API response, etc.).
4. **Choose the technology stack**:
   - Prefer Python standard library (`pathlib`, `argparse`, `json`, `csv`, `logging`, etc.)
   - Add third-party packages only when stdlib cannot do the job — justify each one
   - Pin package versions in justification notes
5. **Identify external dependencies** — APIs, file systems, databases, services the system calls out to.
6. **Note scalability and security considerations** relevant to the requirements.
7. **Clarification rule**: If any requirement is ambiguous and the design choice would significantly change the architecture, ask the user before proceeding. Otherwise, state your assumption and continue.

## Output Format

Write the output to `docs/architecture.md` using this exact structure:

```markdown
# Architecture

## System Overview

[2–3 sentences describing what the system does, its primary actors, and its deployment model (CLI tool, service, library, etc.)]

## Component Diagram

```
[ASCII art showing components as boxes and data flow as arrows]

Example:
┌─────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│  CLI Entry  │────►│   Processor  │────►│   Reporter  │
└─────────────┘     └──────────────┘     └─────────────┘
                            │
                            ▼
                    ┌──────────────┐
                    │  File Store  │
                    └──────────────┘
```

## Component Descriptions

| Component | Responsibility | Key Interfaces |
|---|---|---|
| [Name] | [What it does] | [Inputs it accepts / outputs it produces] |

## Data Flow

Step-by-step narrative of how data moves through the system:

1. User invokes [entry point] with [input]
2. [Component A] reads / parses [input] and produces [intermediate form]
3. ...
N. [Final component] writes [output] to [destination]

## Technology Choices

| Package / Module | Purpose | Justification |
|---|---|---|
| `stdlib: argparse` | CLI argument parsing | Built-in, no dependency needed |
| `third-party: X` | ... | stdlib cannot do Y because Z |

## External Dependencies

| Dependency | Type | Required For | Failure Mode |
|---|---|---|---|
| [API / file / service] | [REST API / filesystem / DB] | [which component uses it] | [what happens if unavailable] |

*(If none: "None — system is fully self-contained.")*

## Security Considerations

- [List each relevant security concern and how the design addresses it]
- At minimum address: input validation, secret handling, output sanitization

## Open Design Questions

| ID | Question | Assumption Made | Impact if Wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| DQ-01 | ... | ... | ... |
```

---

## Quality Criteria

Before finalizing, verify:

- Every functional requirement maps to at least one component
- No component has more than one primary responsibility (single responsibility)
- Data flow narrative is unambiguous — a developer should be able to implement from it
- Technology choices are justified — no unexplained third-party packages
- Security section addresses all NFRs tagged as security
